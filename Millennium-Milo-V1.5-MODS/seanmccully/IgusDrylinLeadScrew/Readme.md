You'll need to print the provided STLs and purchase the parts directly from Igus. I am not entirely sure that the X axis really needs two AntiBacklash nuts, and the Y and Z axis only fit one. You will also not be able to fit 3 screws on the mounts for the nuts, but 2 screws holds them in place just as well. 

## X,Y,Z Axis:
